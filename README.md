## To Do
### Compare movies feature?
Have a page for comparing movies ratings, cast etc.

### Review feature
When user has searched a tv show/movie, 2 calls should go out. One to TMDB for the general data, and another to get my review of that tv show/movie if one exists. This will need to match based on TMDB ID.
